                <h3>Health Risks of Raccoon Infestation</h3>

                <p>Raccoons carry numerous zoonotic diseases that can transmit to humans, making professional intervention crucial. Rabies, raccoon roundworm, leptospirosis, and salmonella are among the raccoon dangers that threaten your family's health. These health risks multiply when raccoon droppings accumulate in attics, walls, or other areas of your home.</p>

                <p>Beyond disease transmission, raccoons cause extensive property damage through their foraging and nesting behaviors. They tear insulation, chew electrical wires, damage roofing materials, and contaminate areas with urine and feces. The longer an infestation persists, the more expensive repairs become, making immediate professional removal a cost-effective investment.</p>

                <h3>Thorough Home & Attic Inspections</h3>

                <p>Every successful raccoon removal begins with a detailed wildlife assessment of your property. Our certified technicians conduct comprehensive attic inspections, examining all potential entry points, nesting areas, and signs of raccoon activity. We look for raccoon signs including droppings, tracks, damaged insulation, torn ductwork, and characteristic scratching marks.</p>

                <p>During the inspection process, we identify active raccoon trails, feeding areas, and denning sites. This information helps us develop a targeted removal strategy that addresses your specific situation. We also assess the extent of any property damage and contamination to provide accurate cleanup estimates.</p>

                <h3>Safe Raccoon Trapping</h3>

                <p>Our safe raccoon trapping methods utilize state-of-the-art equipment designed for maximum effectiveness and animal welfare. We employ live removal techniques that capture raccoons without injury, allowing for humane relocation.

                <p>Strategic trap placement based on our inspection findings maximizes capture success while ensuring the safety of your family and pets. We use appropriate bait and positioning techniques that target raccoons specifically, avoiding accidental capture of non-target animals.</p>

                <h3>Cleanup and Decontamination</h3>

                <p>Professional raccoon cleanup is essential for protecting your family's health and preventing future infestations. Our decontamination services include complete removal of raccoon droppings, contaminated insulation, and nesting materials. We use hospital-grade disinfectants to eliminate harmful bacteria and parasites.</p>

                <p>Odor removal is a critical component of our cleanup process. Raccoon scent markers can attract other wildlife, making thorough decontamination essential for long-term success.

                <h3>Raccoon Proofing & Prevention</h3>

                <p>Effective raccoon prevention requires sealing all potential entry points and eliminating attractants around your property.

                <p>We provide detailed recommendations for maintaining raccoon-free conditions, including proper waste management, pet food storage, and landscape modifications that discourage wildlife activity.

                <h2>Why Raccoons Invade Mobile Homes</h2>

                <p>Mobile's subtropical climate and urban development patterns create ideal conditions for raccoon populations. Understanding raccoon behavior Mobile homeowners encounter helps explain why these animals are drawn to residential areas. Abundant food sources, including pet food, garbage, and fruit trees, make neighborhoods attractive to foraging raccoons.</p>

                <p>Raccoons exhibit distinct nesting habits that bring them into conflict with homeowners. They seek warm, dry, elevated spaces for denning, making attics particularly appealing. Seasonal wildlife patterns show increased home invasions during spring birthing seasons and fall preparation periods when raccoons are most active in seeking shelter.</p>
